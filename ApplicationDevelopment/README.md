Title: Guitar Looper

DESCRIPTION: 
The Guitar Looper is a product described as being an effects looper manager, where it takes inputs and outputs of various effect pedals, and then is able to switch using or not using different effects for a smaller set of buttons to use presets. These presets are desired to be configurable using a mobile app for an android phone, that can connect to the looper via bluetooth. This app ideally will have a mechanism to store currently unused presets, so that they can be switched out more efficiently.

Goals:<br/>
      1. Create a user friendly mobile app.<br/>
      2. Be able to easily add features to app.<br/>
      3. Be able to have multiple presets.<br/>
      4. Have a flawless connection from phone to device through Bluetooth.<br/>
      5. Have application work as an effect looper manager.<br/>
